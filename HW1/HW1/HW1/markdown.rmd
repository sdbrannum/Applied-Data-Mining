This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **R Tools | Publish | Preview** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Data Prep
```{r dataprep}
bank.df <- read.csv("D:/Source Control/ADM/HW1/HW1/UniversalBank.csv")
bank.df <- bank.df[,-c(1,5)] # drop ID and zip code columns.  
# create categorical variable for education
bank.df$Education <- factor(bank.df$Education, levels = c(1,2,3), labels = c("Undergrad", "Graduate", "Advanced/Professional"))
```

## Logistic Regression Model
```{r logit}
logit.reg <- glm(bank.df$Personal.Loan ~., data = bank.df, family = "binomial")
options(scipen=999)
summary(logit.reg)
```
